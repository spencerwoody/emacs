# Emacs configuration by Spencer Woody

Using GNU Emacs 25.3.1

## Contents

- `.emacs` and `.emacs.d/` are for Emacs configuration
- `emacs-reference/` contains reference cards for Emacs, as well as packages I use frequently

## Install 

To use this configuration, clone this repo to your local machine, then run this command from your terminal:
